<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">7.2.2019</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Art is a tool that every person should have and be able to use it for different task as needed. 
Art is created at a young age as an experiment and experience which lights part of the right brain. 
Going through the drawing stages up to decision on if they want to continue using their skill or not. 
I believe that they should view the skill a bit more to realize it can do more than just drawing, it can be molded into a skill they can use. 
Which is the beauty of art, the ability to be molded into something desired. Which art history can show a variety of examples on how art is used.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">My role as a future teacher is to share this idea to students and give them an education that can be used more in the real world.
 I want to ensure that the time used in my classroom will be put to good use for the students in the way of art. 
For I believe that anyone can do art if they put the mind and effort into learning and creating. 
Pushing for deeper thinking on the reason why and how to question what they see and not just except it. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:Century Gothic;color:darkslategrey;background-color:palegreen">Sample Lesson Plans</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Lesson Plan – Introductory to Line</p> 
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Teacher’s Name:   Ms. Clarissa Spahr</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Date:  April 30th,2019 </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Subject Area(s):  Art </p>                                             <p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Grade Level: 8th </p> 
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Concept/Topic: Line </p>                                               <p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa"> Duration: 45 Minutes</p> 
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">DESIRED RESULTS: </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Curriculum Standards: </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">9.1.8 A: Know and use the elements and principles of each art form to create works in the arts and humanities. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">9.1.8 B: Recognize, know, use, and demonstrate a variety of appropriate arts elements and principles to produce, review, and revise original works in art. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">9.1.8 C: Identify and use comprehensive vocabulary within each of the arts forms. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Objectives: </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">The 8th grade art students will be given a variety of materials to create a continuous variety of lines to master the idea. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Big ideas/Key concepts: </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa"> Line is everywhere, wither it is implied lines or not. Everyone writes with line to communicate, to do math with, etc.  Taking this idea and applying it in different forms that can be used in art and I believe that line is the basic form of all art. Four lines creates a box which is a shape, and to change the way art is viewed with a simple line. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">CONTEXT:</p> 
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">This is day three of Colour and Design for the school year. The class is filled with 28 8th graders who are mostly 75% female and 25% male. This course is for students who want to do learn more art from their basic art classes. A girl has an IEP for Aspersers, so I will try my best to make sure she gets involve in this course. Since it is the begging of the semester, so far, the class has been behaving well, but a group of girls have been chatting about some iffy things. I will keep on ear on them during the semester as well.   </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">This lesson plan is to open the idea of what line is and allow them to think more creative on how line can be applied. This is only an intro to the lesson of line, and the first project will lead into a more complex idea of how to apply line. Today is just experimenting with line and figuring out a variety of ways of creating line. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">EVIDENCE: </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">The students will show five different types of lines, and one of them most contain their name in it. I will notice how much the students know about line and later in the lesson unit see if they have improved their ability of control of their lines. Students are encouraged to think outside the box and create what they think is line.</p> 
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Pre-requisites:   </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Students need some basic idea on supplies, and idea of pervious art vocab to use more in-depth vocab. Like know line before would be an outline on the shape but should learn about indirect lines. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Rationale:  </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Since it is the beginning of the new semester, this activity will help me find out where the students are in art and give them a chance to talk to other students in the class. This is also introducing lesson to a whole unit on line. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Learning Launch/Anticipatory Set: </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">” What came first, the subject of art or another subject like English” I believe it is art, and art aided in what is created today as a society. Every has a design to it, and line help created that design. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Lesson Body Description: </p> 
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">The first 10 minutes of class, I will give a power point on what is, artist who use it, and how it is useful for today. Then pass out the paper and tell what the plan is for the activity to do for 30 minutes of the class. Then the last 5 minutes will be used to clean up and collect all the papers so it can be graded and hung later in the hallway during the week. I plan to take attendance during the first 30 mins of work time and then go to each table to see how they are doing. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Materials and Technology:   </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">The basic requirement would be pencil and paper but other material depending on what is available. For what supplies I have, paper, pencil, marker, crayon, colour pencils, glue sticks, scissors, tissue paper, string and boxes for the supplies. Also, a dry easer board and a set of working dry easer markers. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Differentiation:   </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">This lesson will help with making lines and that can be used in other classes. I believe anyone can do the task, since art based of their skill. I will try to teach them more to improve their skill. This project can be done by anyone, but it can challenge everyone different </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Closure:  </p> 
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Now it is time to clean up, after cleanup we are going to look at each group and see their line. State how everyone created a different line and how there can be many ways of creating lines. Ask if anyone has a favorite line and why to the class. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Elastic Activity:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">If there is any time left, I would ask the students how the see line in other classes or in the general setting. For an example “what line is used around the window? is it bold or thin?”. Which makes them open their eye more on what is around them. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:Century Gothic;color:darkslategrey;background-color:palegreen">Classroom Observations</h3></p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Near the end of May and beginning of June, I did 35 hours of student observation with Mr. Cassano at New Brighton High School. Even though it was the very end of the semester, I learned how a school year can wrap up academic wise. I learned that his lesson plans were different then the standards between different schools. The format had all the school info and his at the very top, then had title, vocabulary, materials, and the assignment which was a bit more detailed. Mr. Cassano tries his best not to have any repeats on projects. I did admire it, because it is a practice to think of more ways to teach the same topic. He also started what projects that he wanted to do for the next following year, so he knew what to order more supplies of. </p> 

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">Mr. Cassano sets up the one side of the room for more 2D art in a circle for the students having a focal point that can easily be moved for a new view. Each student got to pick their desk and keep it so that they are comfortable for the semester. The other side of the room was for ceramics which had four work tables set up for good amount of room for students to work. All the supplies were organizing, but I had no idea where supplies were since they were in cabinets. He did have the largest room I have seen for art teachers. I was a bit sad that he didn’t do any medias that he had access to like fabrics and enamel. I understand the reason since it would require another teacher for the number of classes he teach. He had to turn down 45 students for ceramic since the lack of seats viable and he teachers 7 out of 9 periods at the school. He had posters of a small variety of colleges hanging (sadly not a lot of school send out information to the school) and he has some of his own art in the room. He had a website on google that has students works and community-based stuff he does.  </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">When it comes to trouble-some students, either it is too small to punish, or it is big enough to be sent to the office. He explained that out of the years he has been there, this year was the first troublesome class. He also shared his thoughts that when handling students with special needs, its more have a case by case need then having one solution fix all.  </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;color:Arapawa">I personally learned a lot while being there and how each school is different from one another, but each one is always trying their best. Also, that finding how you are teaching is something you should work with and not against.</p>
